## Gradle Dependency

Add this in your root `build.gradle` file (**not** your module `build.gradle` file):

```gradle
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
	}
}
```

Then, add the library to your project `build.gradle`
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.Commit451:YouTubeExtractor:latest.version.here'
}
```

## Usage
If you are familiar with RxJava, the extractor returns a Single:

```kotlin
val extractor = YouTubeExtractor.Builder()
            .build()
extractor.extract("9d8wWcJLnFI")
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
    .subscribe({ extraction ->
        bindVideoResult(extraction)
    }, { t ->
        onError(t)
    })
```
Note: the above example also requires [RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid) for `AndroidSchedulers`

You can also extract the result right away:
```kotlin
// Don't do this on the main thread!
val extraction = extractor.extract("9d8wWcJLnFI")
    .blockingGet()
```

## Video Playback
This library was only created to extract video stream URLs from YouTube, not provide a video player. [ExoMedia](https://github.com/brianwernick/ExoMedia) is a great library for playing the video streams to the user. See the sample app for an example.

## ProGuard
This library uses [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp), [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi#proguard) and [Rhino](https://github.com/facebook/stetho/tree/master/stetho-js-rhino#proguard) under the hood, so you may need to apply their ProGuard rules.

## Notes
This library is intentionally being kept pretty "lightweight", with the main priority being the stream URLs.

Known Failure Points:
- Videos that are age restricted
- Videos that are audio only

It is worth noting that YouTube "alternatives" such as NewPipe are often removed from the Play Store due to licensing, so be cautious of this and other rules when using this library. We are not responsible for misfortune that comes from using this library. 

## Alternatives
There are lots of different libraries that are dedicated to YouTube playback, each with its own pros and cons. This library is dedicated primarily to loading video stream URLs. If you need something more, check out some of these other libraries:
